## Migrate Webpack 2 from Webpack 1
Webpack 2 is currently in beta.
It will minimize your bundle size.

## Better NPM Runner
Node.js supports Windows and Unix.
It is awesome but sometimes terrible because window and unix shell are absolutely different.
[better-npm-run](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-npm-run) solved it and I will apply.
